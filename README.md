# Bias Compass

A Telegram bot that uses OpenAI's [GPT-3.5-Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to detect political bias, narratives, misinformation, or opinion-based journalism practices in news articles.

Inspired by the last chapter of Mark Manson's [_Everything is F*cked_](https://markmanson.net/books/everything-is-fucked).
